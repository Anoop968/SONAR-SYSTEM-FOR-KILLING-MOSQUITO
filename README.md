# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: TATHVA(Tactical Anti-Threat Hyperactive Vibro-Acoustic system)


### Team Members
- Team Lead: ANOOP NARAYAN -COLLEGE OF ENGINNERING KALLOOPPARA
- Member 2: BIMAL GHOSH- COLLEGE OF ENGINNERING KALLOOPPARA
  

### Project Description
TATHVA is a rotating ultrasonic radar system that scans the surroundings for potential mosquito movement and notifies the user through audible alerts played on a laptop speaker.
It‚Äôs intentionally over-engineered for such a tiny threat, making it the perfect entry for a useless project expo while still demonstrating servo control, ultrasonic sensing, and real-time data visualization.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
For decades, humanity has faced an imaginary crisis ‚Äî the need for early-warning radar systems to detect and track mosquitoes before they strike.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
